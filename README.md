# Prevalence of string interpolation among popular programming languages 2004-2020

This repository contains the R code for calculating said relative prevalence, a data set of the [PYPL ranking](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) and my own data set encoding which programming languages added support for [string interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation) at which year.
